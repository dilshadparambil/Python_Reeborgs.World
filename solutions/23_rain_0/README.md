It's raining hard. Water is going to come in through the **open window**, represented by a missing wall, unless Reeborg closes it.  

Have Reeborg:  
1. Move until it stands in front of the open window.  
2. Close it by using the `build_wall()` function.  
3. Turn around and go watch the rain falling outside, with the front door open.  

The **size of the room and location of the window never change**.  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, and `build_wall()`.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(4, 6)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(4, 6)`
