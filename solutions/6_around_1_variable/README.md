Have Reeborg go around the world in the counter-clockwise direction once, and stop at its starting position. Reeborg must not step on the grass. The correct path is shown by the dashed white line. 

*Note the size of the world will change each time a program is ready to run.*

*Hint: Reeborg carries some tokens; you only need to use one.*

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, and `put()`.
  - Either the test `front_is_clear()` or `wall_in_front()`, and `object_here()`.
  - How to use a `while` loop.
  - It might be useful to know how to use the negation of a test (`not` in Python).
  - Ideally, you should define your own functions to make your program easier to understand.

A robot located at (x, y) = `(8, 1)` carries **token:500**
