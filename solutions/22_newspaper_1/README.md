Reeborg must deliver the newspaper **The Northern Star** to the very nice Ms. Ada Lovelace, who always leaves between **one and three tokens** for Reeborg as a gift.  

You must help Reeborg deliver the newspaper and **collect all tokens**.  

## What you need to know:  
  - Before attempting this, you should be able to solve the simpler **Newspaper 0** world.  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, `take()`, `object_here()`, and `put()`.  
  - How to call a function with an **argument**.  
  - The object names `"star"` and `"token"`.  
  - How to use `while` loops.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 1)` carries **token:3**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(1, 1)`
