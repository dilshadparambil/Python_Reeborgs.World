Reeborg must go around the world, collecting all the apples so that he can make apple pies when he gets home.

Try to make your code as short as possible using `for/repeat` loops. `Beware!` The apples keep changing place each time you reload this world.

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, and `take()`.
  - how to use a `for/repeat` loop.

A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 1)` carries :
**apple:19**

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(1, 1)`
