Use the `move()` function and the `turn_left()` function to make Reeborg walk **around the lake**.  
To see what happens, try doing something intentionally wrong (like making Reeborg walk **into the lake**) to observe the error message.  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()` and `turn_left()`.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 1)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(1, 1)`
