Reeborg wants to pick some **strawberries** in its garden. Reeborgâ€™s garden has a very **strange shape**.  

Define a `pick_two_berries()` function that picks up **two strawberries** and puts them on the ground. Use this function **four times** as part of your solution.  
As always, use **comments and whitespace** to make your solution more readable!  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, `take()`, and `put()`.  
  - How to **define functions**.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(5, 1)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(5, 7)`
