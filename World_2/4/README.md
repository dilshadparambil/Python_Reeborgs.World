Use the functions youâ€™ve learned so far to make Reeborg walk down the **gravel path**, picking up dandelions as he finds them, and depositing them in the conveniently placed garbage cans (represented by greyscale dandelion images).  

Use the `pause()` function to have Reeborg **wait at each location** where he finds a dandelion to pick.  
Be sure to use **comments and whitespace** to improve code readability!  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, `take()`, `put()`, and `pause()`.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 5)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(6, 1)`
