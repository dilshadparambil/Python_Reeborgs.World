Reeborg's garden is ready to harvest. Have Reeborg collect all the carrots in his garden.  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, and `take()`.  
  - The test `object_here()`.  
  - How to use a `while` loop or an `if` statement.  
  - You might find it convenient to define a function named `harvest_one_row()` and call this function 6 times.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 1)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - Reeborg must collect **all carrots** in the garden.
