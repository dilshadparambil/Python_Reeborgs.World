Reeborg has entered a hurdles race. Make him run the course, following the path shown.  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()` and `turn_left()`.  

### More advanced  
You may have noticed that your solution has some repeated patterns. If you know how to define functions, define a function named `jump()` and use it to simplify your program.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 1)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(13, 1)`
