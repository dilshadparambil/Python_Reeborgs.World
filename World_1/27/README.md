There was a storm last night and some leaves were blown **all over the yard**.  

Have Reeborg:  
1. Collect all the leaves.  
2. `toss()` them into the compost bin.  
3. Return **back home** when finished.  

This program should also work for **Storm 1**, but it may not be as efficient for cleaning just the path.  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, `take()`, and `toss()`.  
  - How to use the tests `object_here()`, `carries_object()`, `at_goal()`, and either `front_is_clear()` or `wall_in_front()`.  
  - How to use a `while` loop and an `if` statement.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 1)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(1, 1)`
