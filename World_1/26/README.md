There was a storm last night and some leaves were blown onto the gravel path.  

Have Reeborg:  
1. Collect all the leaves.  
2. `toss()` them in the compost bin.  
3. Make sure to end up **back home**.  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()`, `turn_left()`, `take()`, and `toss()`.  
  - How to use the tests `object_here()`, `carries_object()`, and either `front_is_clear()` or `wall_in_front()`.  
  - How to use a `while` loop and an `if` statement.  
  - Ideally, define your own helper functions to make your program easier to understand.  

A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 1)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(1, 1)`
