Reeborg has entered a hurdle race. Make him run the course, following the path shown.  

The **position and number of hurdles changes each time** the world is reloaded.  

## What you need to know:  
  - The functions `move()` and `turn_left()`.  
  - The conditions `front_is_clear()` or `wall_in_front()`, `at_goal()`, and their negation.  
  - How to use a `while` loop and an `if` statement.  
  - Your program should also be valid for worlds **Hurdles 1** and **Hurdles 2**.  


A robot located at (x, y) = `(1, 1)` carries **no objects**  

## Goal to achieve:  
  - The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = `(13, 1)`
